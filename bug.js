This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom styling applied to the preview.  Specifically, when setting the `style` prop of the `Camera` component to an object containing `flex: 1`, the camera preview fails to render correctly, resulting in a blank screen or distorted image. This behavior is inconsistent and seems to be linked to how the camera preview interacts with the layout engine when flexbox is involved.
